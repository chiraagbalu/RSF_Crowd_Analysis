# RSF_Crowd_Analysis
analysis of rsf crowd meter data

this project scrapes the data underlying the website https://recsports.berkeley.edu/rsf-weight-room-crowd-meter/
the website shows a number for how full the rsf is at any given time
many things to work on here - everything is in rsf_alert.py

you can clone this repository and run it on your own machine - just make sure to change the webhook url to your own discord channel
